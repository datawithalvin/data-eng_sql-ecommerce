# eCommerce Transactions Database

In this project, I showcase my SQL and database design skills using a dataset that simulates eCommerce transactions. I have created a PostgreSQL database, designed its schema, populated it with data from CSV files, performed ETL, and implemented other functionalities. I have also utilized Python libraries, specifically SQLAlchemy and psycopg2, to interact with the database.

### What's in Here?
* raw-datasets/: This folder contains the raw CSV data that I used to populate the database. The CSV files were extracted from Google Big Query Public Data.
* notebooks/: In this folder, you will find Jupyter notebooks where I demonstrate how to interact with the database using Python and perform ETL process.
* sql-queries/: Here, you will find an .sql file with the SQL queries I used to create the tables in the database, perform ETL, and answer business-related questions.
